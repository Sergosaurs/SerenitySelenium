Repository mirroring

Repository mirroring allows for mirroring of repositories to and from external sources. It can be used to mirror branches, tags, and commits between repositories.

A repository mirror at GitLab will be updated automatically. You can also manually trigger an update at most once every 5 minutes on GitLab.com with the limit set by the administrator on self-managed instances.
